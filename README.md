### The _international_ Dvorak
A personal version of the Dvorak keyboard layout for Windows, with support for 99% of Latin alphabet languages, IPA (the International Phonetic Alphabet), Greek letters and several mathematical symbols.

## Why? Well, mostly for two reasons:

Firstly, I like the Dvorak keyboard layout. Some have argued that it is better and faster than the standard Qwerty layout, but this is not the main reason I use it. I just use it for fun, and to booster my neuroplasticity. So in some way, we can say it's not quite different than going out for running: running, you challenge your muscles by finding pleasure in seeking discomfort, doing something your body isn't willing to do; changing the keyboard layout is a funny way to do something similar to my neural connections. Other people do this by playing a musical instrument, or learning poems by heart. The same way I don't want to convince anyone to go out for running, to learn a new language or to play a musical instrument, I don't want to convince anyone to switch the keyboard they are comfortable using. But in case you are interested, here is my keyboard layout.

Secondly, in my everyday life I use several languages, and often I deal with mathematical symbols or IPA characters. They are hard to find with most keyboard layouts, let alone for a usually English-only keyboard such as the Dvorak. So to solve this, I have used the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MKLC), which you can download from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339

In case you don't want to use my .klc file, if you don't want to make any changes or install the MKLC, you can just download the installer for Windows.

For your convenience, I have included as well the pdf with the image I have used to create the keyboard stickers.

## Features

This is an incomplete list. For the complete list, please check the .klc file.
